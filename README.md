Within this repository, you will find various data analysis projects implemented in Python through Jupyter Notebook. These projects encompass a range of topics, such as web scraping data from Amazon and obtaining the top 250 movies with their corresponding IMDB rating from the IMDB website. Additionally, I have included exploratory data analysis on roller coasters and weather condition data sets.
